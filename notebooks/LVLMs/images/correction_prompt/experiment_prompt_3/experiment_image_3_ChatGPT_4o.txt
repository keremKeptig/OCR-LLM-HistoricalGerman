Here are the layout errors based on the provided image:

    Page number "320" belongs in its own box â€“ it is clearly a header and not part of the main body text.

    The main red box does not capture the margin or any potential sidenotes or footnotes that might be present outside the main text area.

    There is a decorative element in the top right corner (partially visible red emblem or illustration) that may be part of a footnote or decorative marginalia and should be boxed separately if it contains meaningful content.

Let me know if you want the corrected bounding box coordinates or a visual mockup.
