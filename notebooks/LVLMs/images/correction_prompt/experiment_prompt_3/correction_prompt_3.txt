I provided a page from an old article with bounding boxes.
The bounding boxes might not always be right.
They might miss marginalia, footnotes, descriptions, page descriptors etc. (We will call all that marginalia)
Your job is to point out the incorrect bounding boxes. Reading the text might help you find stuff that does not make sense and thus belongs into it's own box.

If you see layout error write a list that may look like this:
1. Page number "176" belongs in it's own box
2. "Fig 5. Prinz Eugen von Savoyen" belongs into it's own box
3. There are boxes without text in them on the left side
4. "Commercio interno ed" is a sidenode (marginalia) and should have it's own box
5. "1858 - 1852" is a footnote and should have it's own box
