Here are the layout errors in the provided page with respect to bounding boxes:

    Page number "125" belongs in its own box.

    Section title "4. Die Kultur des Perikleischen Zeitalters" belongs in its own box.

These elements are not part of the main body text and should be boxed separately to accurately reflect the document's structure. There do not appear to be any empty or extraneous boxes, and no other marginalia or footnotes are visible on this page.
