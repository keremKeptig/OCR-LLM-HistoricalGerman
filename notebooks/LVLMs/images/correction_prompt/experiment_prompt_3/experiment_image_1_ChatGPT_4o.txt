Here are the layout errors I identified in the provided page:

    Page number "126" belongs in its own box (currently grouped with the section title).

    "IV. Periode 275–30 v. Chr. Rom gewinnt die Weltherrschaft." is a section title and should be in its own box.

    "Lage und Bedeutung der Stadt." is marginalia (a sidebar heading) and should be in its own box.

    "Verfassung." is also marginalia and should have its own box.

    "Abb. 27. Ansicht der Häfen von Karthago.*" is a figure description and should be in its own box.

    The footnote starting with "Aufgenommen von der Burg (Byrsa)..." is a footnote and should be in its own box.

    There are red boxes on the illustration that do not correspond to any text—they might have been mistakenly added or are outlining non-textual elements.

These adjustments will help ensure a semantically accurate segmentation of the document layout.
