Here are the incorrect bounding boxes based on the image:

    "Fig. 8. Darius mit Dienern (über ihm Ormuzd). Wandbild im Palast zu Persepolis." – This is a figure caption and should belong in marginalia (blue), but it is currently in red (paragraph).

    "und Darius war gerettet. Histiäus wurde belohnt, Miltiades floh in seine griechische Heimat." – This is part of the main narrative and belongs in a paragraph (red), but it is currently marked as marginalia (blue).

Everything else seems to be appropriately labeled based on the context and formatting.

Final list:

    "Fig. 8. Darius mit Dienern (über ihm Ormuzd)..." belongs in marginalia (blue)

    "und Darius war gerettet..." is a paragraph and should be in red, not blue
