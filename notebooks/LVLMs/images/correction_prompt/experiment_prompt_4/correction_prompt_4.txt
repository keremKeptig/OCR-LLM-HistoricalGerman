I provided a page from an old article with colored bounding boxes.
The colored bounding boxes might not always be right.
Red means it's a paragraph.
Blue means it's marginalia (foot-nodes, side-notes, page-number, paragraph, article-name etc).

Our job is to point out the incorrect bounding boxes. Reading the text will help you find stuff that does not make sense and thus belongs into a different class.

In the end you might get a list that could look like this:
1. Page number "176" belongs in marginalia (blue)
2. "Fig 5. Prinz Eugen von Savoyen" belongs in marginalia (blue)
3. There are boxes without text in them on the left side
4. "Commercio interno ed" is a sidenode (marginalia) and should belong in marginalia (blue)
5. "1858 - 1852" is a footnote and should belong in marginalia (blue)

It's always important to look at the color of the box! Blue is marginalia and red is a paragraph. Sometimes everything will be okay and there is nothing to correct.
