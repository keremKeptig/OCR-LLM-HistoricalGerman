Here are the issues with the bounding boxes based on the image:

    "Rückzug der Skythen." – This is a sidenote and should belong in marginalia (blue), not paragraph (red).

    "Rückzug der Perser." – This is also a sidenote and should belong in marginalia (blue), not paragraph (red).

    "Die Griechen bei der Brücke." – This is a sidenote and should belong in marginalia (blue), not paragraph (red).

    "16" (at the top center of the page) – This is the page number and should be in marginalia (blue), not paragraph (red).

    "Fig. 8. Darius mit Dienern (über ihm Ormuzd)." – This is a figure caption and should be classified as marginalia (blue), not paragraph (red).

    "Wandbild im Palast zu Persepolis." – This is part of the figure caption and should also be in marginalia (blue), not paragraph (red).

    "und Darius war gerettet. Histiäus wurde belohnt, Miltiades floh in seine griechische Heimat." – This is part of the main paragraph and is correctly marked red.

Let me know if you'd like these changes applied to an annotation file.
